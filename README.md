# Real-time-Supervised-Fraud-detection-Model-on-Applications-Data
Looking at the application's history from several individuals by monitoring entities (SSN, Name, Address, ZipCode, dob, home phone) with fraud label to make a real-time fraud detection model
Steps Followed: 
a) Data cleaning and Manipulation
b) Feature Engineering (Expert variables were created using Days since, Velocity of applications according to specific entities)
c) Feature Selection using KS and FDR 
d) Further, feature selection using Random Forest Wrapper
e) Modelling on selected features using RF and Fraud labels were predicted
